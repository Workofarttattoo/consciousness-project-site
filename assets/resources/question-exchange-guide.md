# Question Exchange Forum Guide

A moderated space for surfacing open problems, coordinating experiments, and sharing field reports.

## Channels
- **Weekly Prompts** — post provocations and respond asynchronously.
- **Lab Matchmaking** — list skills, equipment, or study participants you can contribute.
- **Field Reports** — share experimental updates and reflective notes.
- **Support Hub** — IRB templates, funding calls, ethics discussions, integration support.

## Posting Guidelines
1. Frame questions with relevant literature and current hypotheses.
2. Tag posts with discipline, modality, and urgency for easier routing.
3. Summarize outcomes or decisions to close the loop on each thread.
4. Default to public artifacts when possible; mark sensitive data clearly.

## Moderation
- Community hosts rotate quarterly, with mini retrospective sessions.
- Dedicated channels for safety or conduct concerns (`@hosts`
  or `conduct@consciousness.project`).
